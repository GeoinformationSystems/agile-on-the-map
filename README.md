# Putting AGILE on the Map

Georeferencing all conference papers of the AGILE conference series, <>, to visualize research contributions over time and space.

## Build website

The website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com).
It uses the [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima/) theme.

To build and serve the website locally, run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

There's [plenty](https://docs.w3cub.com/jekyll/configuration/) of documentation around on Jekyll - docs here are therefore kept to a minimum.
