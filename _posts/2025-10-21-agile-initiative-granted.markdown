We are very excited to announce that our project proposal "Putting AGILE on the Map" has been granted funding by AGILE as an AGILE initiative! ðŸŽ‰

We look forward to the challenge of making all research contributions published at the AGILE conference series discoverable via geospatial metadata over the next months.
See the full project description on our [about page](/about/).

Stay tuned for updates on our progress on this website ðŸš€.
